# JMS

@@@ note { title="Java Message Service (JMS)" }

The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a Java message-oriented middleware API for sending messages between two or more clients. It is an implementation to handle the producer–consumer problem. JMS is a part of the [Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jms-concepts001.htm#BNCDR), and was defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems, but which has since been guided by the Java Community Process. It is a messaging standard that allows application components based on Java EE to create, send, receive, and read messages. It allows the communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.
