 * It is a very trivial IronMQ push stage. It push the message to IronMq as soon as they are pushed to this Stage.
 *
 * Because of that it does not guarantee the order of the produced messages and does not apply any backpressure. A more
 * sophisticated implementation will buffer the messages before pushing them and allow only a certain amount of parallel
 * requests.
