/**
 * Internal Api
 *
 * Splits up a byte stream source into sub-flows of a minimum size while maintaining a Context. Does not attempt to
 * create chunks of an exact size. Unlike `SplitAfterSize` there is no maximum size since this would imply splitting
 * up a Context which is not possible to do if the Context is generic.
 *
 * This also means that `SplitAfterSizeContext` currently doesn't support buffering since that would require a way to
 * serialize the Context in the case of a disk buffer which is currently unsupported (we would have to add in a
 * C => ByteString serializer in the public API)
