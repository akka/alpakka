/**
 * Internal API.
 *
 * Simplest AMQP flow. Published messages without any delivery guarantees. Result is emitted as soon as message is
 * published. Because there it's not verified whether message is confirmed or rejected, results are emitted always
 * as confirmed. Since result is always confirmed, it would also make sense to emit just plain `passThrough` object
 * instead of complete [[WriteResult]] (possibly it would be less confusing for users), but [[WriteResult]] is used
 * for consistency with other variants and to make the flow ready for any possible future [[WriteResult]] extensions.
