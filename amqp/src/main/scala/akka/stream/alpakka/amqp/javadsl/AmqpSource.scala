   * Java API:
   * The `committableSource` makes it possible to commit (ack/nack) messages to RabbitMQ.
   * This is useful when "at-least once delivery" is desired, as each message will likely be
   * delivered one time but in failure cases could be duplicated.
   *
   * If you commit the offset before processing the message you get "at-most once delivery" semantics,
   * and for that there is a [[#atMostOnceSource]].
   *
   * Compared to auto-commit, this gives exact control over when a message is considered consumed.
