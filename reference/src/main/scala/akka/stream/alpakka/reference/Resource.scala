/**
 * Some connectors might require an external resource that is used in the
 * Source, Flow and/or Sink factories.
 *
 * For example dynamodb connector needs a DynamoClient to create Sources and Flows.
 * Another example is Google Pub Sub gRPC connector that uses Grpc Publishers and
 * Subscribers to create Sources and Sinks. Another connector, Alpakka Kafka, uses
 * an actor that can be shared across different streams.
 *
 * If your connector uses such a resource and it is possible to reuse that resource
 * across different Akka Stream operator factories, put that resource to a separate
